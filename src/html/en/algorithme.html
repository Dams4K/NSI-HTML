      <h1>Algorithms</h1>
	  <h3>What's an Algorithm?</h3>
      <p>
	    An <strong>algorithm</strong> is actually a step-by-step procedure. It is a set of rules to follow to accomplish a task or solve a problem.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Long before the emergence of computing, humans were actually already using algorithms.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In computer programming, algorithms are sets of rules that tell the computer how to perform a task. In reality, a computer program is an algorithm that tells the computer what steps to perform and in what order to <strong>achieve a specific task</strong>. They are written using a <strong>programming language</strong>.
	  </p>
	  <h3>The different types of algorithms</h3>
	  <p>
	    There is a wide variety of algorithms, classified according to the concepts they use to accomplish a task. Here are the main categories.
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	  <li>
		<strong>"Brute force" algorithms</strong> consist of testing all possible solutions until the best one is found. A randomized algorithm uses a random number at least once during the computation to find the solution to the problem.
	  </li>
	  </br>
	  <li>
	    A <strong>greedy algorithm</strong> aims to find an optimal solution for the overall problem.
	  </li>
	  </br>
	  <li>
	    A <strong>recursive algorithm</strong> allows you to solve the simplest version of a problem and then solve larger and larger versions until you find the solution to the original problem.
	  </li>
	  </br>
	  <li>
	    A <strong>dynamic programming algorithm</strong> breaks down a complex problem into a collection of simpler subproblems. All these subproblems are solved once, and their solution is stored for future use.
	  </li>
	  </ul>
	  <h3>Sorting algorithms</h3>
	  <p>
		A sorting algorithm allows you to place the elements of a list in a certain order.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    There are many sorting algorithms, with their pros and cons. Here are some examples:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <strong>Linear sorting algorithms</strong> find the smallest items in a list, sort them, add them to a new list, and remove them from the original list.
	    </li>
		</br>
		<li>
		  The <strong>sort by bubble</strong> consists in comparing the first two elements of the list, and inverting them if the first is greater than the second.
		</li>
		</br>
		<li>
		  <strong>Insertion sort</strong> compares each item in the list with previous items until a smaller item is found.
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h3>How are algorithms used in computer science?</h3>
	  <p>
	    It is these instructions that allow the computer to perform tasks. Computer programs themselves are algorithms written in programming languages.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Algorithms also play a key role in the functioning of social networks, for example. They are the ones who decide which publications are displayed or which advertisements are offered to the user.
