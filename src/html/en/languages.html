      <!-- Introduction -->
      <div>
        <h2 id ="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          When you want to communicate with someone, you have to know how to speak the same language, otherwise it is difficult to understand each other. Well, with a machine or more particularly a computer it is exactly the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difficulty is that a computer only understands 1 and 0. So, to simplify our existence and therefore to be able to communicate easily with a computer,
          <a href="programming_language.html">programming languages</a> were created and are used.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are precisely several types of classifications on its languages.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- 1 - Langage machine -->
      <div>
        <h2 id ="lg_machine">1 - Machine language</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>machine language</strong> also called <strong>binary language</strong>, it is with this language that computers work. It consists of using two states (represented by the numbers 0 and 1) to encode information (text, images, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>machin language</strong>, the programmer must enter each command and all the data in <strong>binary form</strong> ie in the form of a series of <strong>bytes</strong>.
          Each byte comprises a succession of <strong>8 bits</strong>. Each <strong>bit</strong> is represented by a 1 or a 0. Here is an example of a machine language command with 2 bytes: 11001010 00010111.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's not forget that any information whether text, images, music or video is encoded in <strong>binary language</strong>, and to mention the size of a file
		  we use certain measures, namely: <strong>the kilobyte, the megabyte, the gigabyte or even the terabyte.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>


      <!-- 2 - Langage assembleur (assembly language) -->
      <div>
        <h2 id="lg_assembleur">2 - Assembly language</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Assembly language</strong> is a low-level language close to <strong>machine language</strong> which can be directly interpreted by the computer's microprocessor.
        </p>
        <p>
          It consists in representing the combinations of bits used in <strong>binary language</strong> by easy-to-remember symbols which are then transcribed by a software called assembler in <strong>machine language</strong>, then executed by the computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike a high level language (Java, C, C++), there is a correspondence between the assembly code and the <strong>machine language</strong>, so it is possible to translate the code in both directions without loss of information.</p>
        <p>
          Each microprocessor has its own <strong>machine language</strong>, and therefore its own <strong>assembly language</strong>. This is a problem for computer scientists so much so that to remedy it <strong>advanced (or high-level) languages</strong> have been created so that they can run on all processors, and all platforms (Windows , Linux, Mac OS).
        </p>
      </div>


      <!-- 3 - Langage dit "de haut niveau" -->
      <div>
        <h2 id="lg_haut_niveau">3 - High-level language</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>high-level language</strong> is a language that accomplishes a lot for a minimum of code and programming effort. There are a lot of them such as: Pascal, Java, C, C++, C#, Visual Basic, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Perl etc...
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike <strong>assembly language</strong> which is very close to <strong>machine language</strong>, they offer layers that make the material abstract. <strong>The assembler</strong> does not use advanced structures such as loops (while, for) and conditions (if, switch) whereas the latter are an integral part in <strong>advanced languages</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The family of <strong>advanced languages</strong> can be divided into two main categories:
        </p>
        
        
        <!-- a) Langages de scripts -->
        <div>
          <h3 id="lg_scripts">a) Script language</h3>
          <p>
            A script is a sequence of commands intended to be executed in their order of appearance, line by line, instruction by instruction, which can result in a more or less noticeable slowness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scripting languages also use variables, control structures (loops, conditions).
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Some examples:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> which is a code for programming <strong>interactive user interfaces</strong> useful for programming websites, improving the positions and indexing of pages in search engine results.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>PHP</strong> whose main role is to develop <strong>better communication between the web page and the server</strong>. Guarantor of the stability of the pages, it is however invisible on the client side unlike JavaScript.
          </p>
        </div>


        <!-- b) Langages compilés (langages interprétés) -->
        <div>
          <h3 id="lg_compiles">b) Compiled languages (interpreted languages)</h3>
          <p>
             A compiled language is a language where all instructions are translated into binary code before being executed by a compiler.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is decoded and then executed instruction by instruction during the execution of the program, which translates into faster execution.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Some examples:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>C language</strong> which is an essential programming language for programming a video game for example or a Web application on Microsoft. It has evolved with the appearance of new languages using its syntax, such as C++ and C#.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Python</strong> is a cross-platform language that allows object-oriented programming and is placed under a free license used in mathematics, finance or scientific research…
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      

      <!-- 4 - Langage de balisage -->
      <div>
        <h2 id="lg_balisage">4 - Markup language</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>markup language</strong> is based on so-called <strong>tags</strong>, which are <strong>tags</strong> with which data (words, text etc.) to give them meaning (this is a paragraph, this is a title, quote etc.) that can be made visual (italics, bold, text color etc.) and that we can label this data in framing them with these tags.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>HTML</strong> (HyperText Markup Language)

          </li>
          <li><strong>XML, SGML, XHTML</strong> (Xtensible HyperTextMarkup Language).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>


      <!-- 5 - Langage de requête -->
      <div>
        <h2 id="lg_requete">5 - Query language</h2>
        <p>
          A query language most often qualifies the languages specific to databases, they are represented in particular by the <strong>SQL</strong> (Structured Query Language) in French simply allows you to manage a database, for example to query it, insert data or delete others, ask it to bring out data according to criteria that I set for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have now learned the types of computer languages and the usefulness of having created so many.
